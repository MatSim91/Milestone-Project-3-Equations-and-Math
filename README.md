The Compendium of Scientists is a project created to gather information about all the scientists that contributed in any scientific area and that helped in the development of our society as we know it. The project idea was to developed an open website, similar Wikipedia, where any registered member can contribute to the Compendium of Scientists by adding and modifying any scientist in the database.

# User Experience

The site was made with the intention of being bery easy for any user to navigate through it, to register an account, login/logout and edit and add new scientists to the database. Users can navigate to all the pages through the navbar and by selecting each scientist to view them in more details they open the options to edit or to delete the scientist.

While viewing the website the experience I wanted the user to feel was not being too distracted by colors as the main intent of the site is to provide written information and knowledge, so that is why I chose neutral colors like Black, White and Grey. Also due to the Science having such a large history and coming from such a long way these colors would give a more old look to the site, while the modern font would show the more futuristic and modern side. I wanted to combine old and new to represent that science is our past, our present and our future.

-   ## Design
    -   ### Colour Scheme

        - The Colour Scheme was carefully chosen to provide a neutral and not so flashy website to the User. As several famous scientists lived in a century where color photography was not yet invented (prior to 1907) the palette was chosen to show that scientific history is old and it comes a long way. I didn't want to make the website colors to stand out more than the scientist's pictures.

        - [Coolors](https://coolors.co/000000-ffffff-727272-e9e9e9-546e7a) was used to choose the color palette.

        - The main colors used were: Black [#000000], White [#FFFFFF], Sonic Silver [#727272], Platinum [#E9E9E9] and Cadet [#546E7A].

        ![Color Palette](static/images/project/coolors.jpg)

    -   ### Typography

        - The font chosen was the Barlow font. I have chosen this font to give a more modern/futuristic look to the site. As the color palette shows a more old and historic site I wanted to balance things out with a modern font. Even though the scientific discoveries are scattered along the centuries and they marked our past history, the science and the discoveries are also the future. By choosing the right Font and Color was an attempt to find a balance between the past-future.

        - The font was imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)


*   ## Wireframes

    - The wireframe was developed using [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

# Deployment

## GitHub Pages 

**Under the repository page:**

    1. Click on Settings 
    2. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section 
    3. Select the Source Branch 
    4. Click Save.

- For this project, I have used the cloud-based IDE [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) and [GitHub](http://github.com/) as a free git repository hosting.

    1. I started the project by creating a new Repository on GitHub and loading the [Code Institute Gitpod Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).

    2. Installed the [Gitpod extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-dev-environments-i/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) and on my GitHub repo I clicked on the Gitpod button to create a new Master Workspace on GitPod.

    3. After creating the workspace I developed the website using Gitpod and pushing my commits to GitHub using the following commands:
        - `git add "file-name"` - To add a file for staging.
        - `git commit -m "description-of-update"` - To commit.
        - `git push` - To push my commits to GitHub
        - I have also used extra git commands such as: 
        - `python3 -m http.server` - To run a preview of the website on the browser.
        - `git status` - To display the current state of the working directory and the staging area.

## Heroku

- To deploy the app using Heroku, go through the following steps:

    1. Use pip3 freeze > `requirements.txt` to create a list of the dependencies.

    2. Create a `Procfile` by running this command on the CLI: `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`

    3. Run `git add .`, `git commit -m`, and `git push`, to push the project files to your GitHub repository.

    4. Navigate to Heroku, log in and create a new app by clicking on the 'New' and 'Create New App'. Enter your app name and select your region and create app.

    5. Under the 'Deploy' tab, select 'GitHub - Connect to GitHub'.
    
    6. Enter your repository's name in the input field, and connect once found.

    7. To set your environment variables navigate to the 'Settings' tab and scroll down to 'reveal config vars'

    8. Add the config vars:

    | Key | Value |
    |:---:|:-----:|
    | IP | 0.0.0.0 |
    | PORT | 5000 |
    | MONGO_DBNAME | `<database_name>` |
    | MONGO_URI | `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.ar4ah.mongodb.net/<database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority` |
    | SECRET_KEY | `<Your secret Key>` |

    9. Navigate to the 'Deploy' tab. To enable automatic deployment, scroll down to the 'Automatic Deploys' section.

    10. Choose your GitHub branch and enable automatic deployment.
